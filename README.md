# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> Elixir (Phoenix / Absinthe / GraphQL) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres (in spirit) to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec.

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged backend application built with **Elixir, Phoenix and Absinthe** including CRUD operations, authentication, pagination, and more.

This won't work with existing RealWorld front-ends, but we plan to write one or more example front ends
